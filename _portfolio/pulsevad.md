Overview
=========
The purpose of this project is to design, development and testing processes of the new Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) and its peripheral components: leads, controller and sensors. At the moment, we focus on the leads (or drivelines) used in the VADs and focus on their key requirements for them to operate in VAD systems successfully.
