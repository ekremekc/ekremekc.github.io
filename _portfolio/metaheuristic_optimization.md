We are interested in different metaheuristic algorithms to obtain combinatorial solutions to the optimization problems. Some algorithms we use are:

* [Ant Colony Optimization](https://github.com/ekremekc/Ant-Colony-Optimization)
* [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/ekremekc/optimization/blob/master/Metaheuristics/genetic_algorithm.py)
* [Bees Algorithm](https://github.com/ekremekc/optimization/blob/master/Metaheuristics/bees_algorithm.py)
