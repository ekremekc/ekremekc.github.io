As we are interested in optimization problems in engineering, we need to represent the geometry of the system and simulate the relevant physics through various numerical tools. We heavily use finite element method when discretizing the partial differential equations. We aim to be licence-independent when using the numerical tools. We specialize in the applications with [FEniCS project](https://fenicsproject.org/) and its components. Some of them are, [Ubuntu/Linux](https://ubuntu.com/), [FEniCSx](https://github.com/FEniCS), [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/overview/), [SLEPc](https://slepc.upv.es/), [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/). We present some of our research themes in this section.
