We have introduced a new numerical healing metric for wound healing using FEM!

If it is interesting, take a glance at the paper from [here](https://ekremekc.github.io/files/articles/2025BMM.pdf).

We have strong open-source modelling capabilities in our group in KFUPM. If you are interested in wound healing modelling, or hydrogel design for drug delivery applications, please do not hesitate to send us an e-mail to [ekrem.ekici@kfupm.edu.sa](mailto:ekrem.ekici@kfupm.edu.sa)! 

I am grateful to my colleague Ahmed S. Dalaq for conceptualizing the need for a precise wound healing modeling. Further thanks can go to IRC-Biosystems and Machines for the fruitful environment and Yükseköğretim ve Yurt Dışı Eğitim Genel Müdürlüğü for funding my postgraduate studies.

If you prefer journal format version of the paper, the link is [here](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10237-025-02029-3?sharing_token=70oM1C-h5SYVQJndAmvvofe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4UroAo9ToHyHBv-K-wBVlZxjqdFbsvCMxykbTaITmqF1g-6ATB1XiVJVHP0TB_RE9oLBPyLeMsPOyIgAXJqLi3iHJLC6Lk_-WRGlYw_AtQT9VI0lc0ifaJpTmb2_jcXI4%3D).
