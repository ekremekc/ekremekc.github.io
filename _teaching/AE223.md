I am teaching AE223 this term in Aerospace Engineering Department. We cover the AE223 lab in two parts:

**PART I: Fluid Mechanics**

- Viscosity Measurement 
- Laminar and Turbulent Flow Visualization
- Pitot Tube Experiment
- Venturi Meter
- Impact of Jet
- Pelton Wheel

**PART II: Aerodynamics**

- Flow Over a Bend
- Introduction to Wind Tunnel
- Lift and Drag Measurement
- Drag Over Different Geometries
- Pressure Coefficient Over a Cylindrical Surface
- Smoke Flow Visualization

 The suggested reading could be;

* Introduction to Flight by John Anderson (2021)
