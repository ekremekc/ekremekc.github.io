160 hours of teaching for Computer Science module on 2023 and 2024 summers.

Overview
======

In this course, many important practical and theoretical aspects of computing, hardware systems and programming are introduced in the context of current trends in technology. The sessions are grouped into the five major areas of computer science study and research: programming, algorithms, models of computation, computer networks, machine learning and artificial intelligence and their applications. Each session is focused on a core concept of the field such as object-orientation, algorithms, networks or machine learning. Python programming language is preferred because of its versatility, robustness and fast-growing trend. The morning lectures served as a high-level overview of a topic, including the historical background, motivating questions, some technical details and practical examples. In the afternoon, the student is invited to put a new skill and knowledge to use by attempting some programming exercises that illustrate the concepts presented earlier. These exercises included libraries to explore algorithm design such as implementing a function that calculates the factorial of the given number, traffic-light simulation using object-orientation to design a practical graphical user interface, genetic algorithm implementation to solve knapsack problem, online chatroom programming using Bluetooth and WiFi technologies as well as implementing simplest machine learning algorithm, one layer neural network, to predict a new given scenario by training the example data.
